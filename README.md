## Assignment 1
Tokenize input via regular expressions, apply a lexicon for sentiment classification, use a logistic regression for sentiment classification.


## Assignment 2
Word Sense Disambiguation with one-hot encodings, and used Logistic Regression with cross-entropy loss. Then extracted PCA word embeddings to find distance betweeen words and then ran logistic regression with the embeddings.

## Assignment 3
Create a probabilistic language model by extracting unigram, bigram and trigram counts, and get language model probabilities by getting probabilities of bigram and interpolated trigram by using add-one smoothing. Then generated random sentences from these probabilities.
